### What is this?
This is a ready-to-use html code template that allows you to create an interactive image viewer. This viewer requires at least two image to be compared side by side, with a handle that lets you swipe the screen left and right. Try the following demo that compares maps in Los Angeles:

### How does it work?
This project borrows from the following Zev Ross blog post:

According to Zev, the following describes the origins of the project:
<blockquote>
The jQuery Before/After plugin is a great interactive tool to explore changes through time. This plugin has been used to great effect by the New York Times to show changes in Japan before and after the tsunami that destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. In most examples of the plugin, though, the maps are static images and the user cannot zoom or pan.

Thanks to the work of Graham MacDonald at the Urban Institute there is a tool that allows for the combination of the Before/After plugin with a slippy map (the kind that lets you zoom and pan). You can read Grahamâ€™s discussion but we will provide a walk-through of the code in this post. By the way, the Urban Institute has a very nice implementation of the functionality in their Poverty and Race in America map.
